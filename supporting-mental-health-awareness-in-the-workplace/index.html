                Promoting mental health awareness in the workplace fosters a supportive and inclusive organizational culture where employees feel comfortable seeking help and support. By providing resources such as employee assistance programs, mental health training, and flexible work arrangements, employers can create a stigma-free environment where mental health is prioritized. Supporting employee well-being not only improves morale and productivity but also reduces absenteeism and turnover, benefiting both employees and employers alike.
                <br>
                Organizations can raise awareness about mental health by hosting workshops, seminars, and awareness campaigns that educate employees about common mental health issues and available resources. By fostering a culture of openness and support, workplaces can promote mental health awareness and create healthier, more resilient teams.
